# healer-words
This is a website that I'm working to help people to feel better about themselves, trying to offer phrases that may find some kind of empathy, belonging, motivational, etc..

In this main-branch I'll put the files that already were uploaded.

The site is getting a random message from the xml file and showing off to the user by the page loading or pushing the "button".
It has two "arrows" to left and to right on oposed screen's side to indicate a content to be viewed.
It is with two languages EN-US and PT-BR.


# Next Update

Share it on Twitter with an image preseted and change the layout of the "content" from the page.
